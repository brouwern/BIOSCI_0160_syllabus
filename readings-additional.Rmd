# Readings: Additional readings

Many weeks there will be a short to medium-length additional reading to supplement the book.  

Links and/or PDFs for these materials will be provided.  These may be associated with the upcoming recitation or lecture, and some will be from the primary scientific literature.   

I have carefully selected and edited these readings and I highly recommend that you read them AND refer back to them when reviewing for tests.

Optional review readings may also be posted prior to tests.  These will be clearly marked as optional.
