# Material in the course is cumulative!

Content within the course is cumulative, with each exam referring back to concepts from previous material!  

This integration will occur within the lectures also so you shouldn't be surprised by the connections being made.  

The three most common recurring themes will be:

1. Data analysis methods (scatterplots, histograms etc.)
2. Mutations
3. Phylogenetic trees.

Practice tests and problems sets will be available so you will be able to see how the content in different units relates.
