# General Education Requirement

This course fulfills 1 Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences Natural Science General Education Requirement (GER) as described for the GERs starting Fall 2018 (term 2191). That GER reads as follows:

> "Three Courses in the Natural Sciences: These will be courses that introduce students to scientific principles and concepts rather than offering a simple codification of facts in a discipline or a history of a discipline. The courses may be interdisciplinary, and no more than two courses may have the same primary departmental sponsor."
