This is the syllabus for Dr. Brouwer’s section of Foundations of Biology 2. The syllabus is organized into sections accessible via the menu on the left. The first few sections are those students most often need to be familiar with at the beginning of the semester. After that sections are organized approximately alphabetically by major topics. You can search for terms using the “Search” panel in the top-left corner. Some policies related to exams and assignments may not be finalized until the first day of class. I also reserve the right to update and modify the schedule as needed. All students will be informed verbally and via email about any changes.

Further details will be provided later in the syllabus. 5.1 Weekly Course Components Foundations of Biology 2 is an in-person course. There are 4 main forms of delivering material and interaction: Lectures: In-person, Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays Recitation: Fridays. Office Hours with Dr. Brouwer throughout the week. Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) office hours throughout the week. 5.2 Assessments The primary form of assessment in the course will be 3 “mini-tests”, each covering ~8 lectures of material Approximately 80% of your grade will be based on these tests. Other primary forms of assessment and practice include Assignments Practice tests taken during recitation Exam rematches taken during recitation Other recitation activities to build skill and comprehensions Numerous short quizzes before and after lecture to build vocab and test comprehension As detailed elsewhere in the syllabus a portion of each of these individuals components of your grade will be dropped. Sometimes assignments or questions will be marked as being based partially or entirely scored for participation. These assignments ARE required - “for participation” does NOT mean optional. Occasionally, fully optional assignments worth 0 points will be released - these will be clearly marked as worth 0 points and for practice only. The syllabus will take you step-by-step through all the policies related to these elements of the course. "],["officehours.html", "6 Office Hours 6.1 Dr. Brouwer office hours 6.2 UTA Office Hours", " 6 Office Hours 6.1 Dr. Brouwer office hours Office hours will be held each week starting the second week of class. See the Canvas homepage for times. (These are subject to modification once the semester begins) Office hours are NOT the day after an exam, or finals week. Office hours may be available via Zoom but will not be recorded. Some guidelines for office hours: Don’t be intimidated by office hours. One of my favorite parts of my job is talking with students one-on-one. Be prepared for office hours. Come with specific questions related to slides, figures, etc. But if you just want to listen, that’s totally cool Office hours are for everyone. If multiple people show up I will alternate between them to answer their questions. If I feel I have answered your main questions I may ask that we table our discussion to cover other questions. Note: During finals week I do not hold office hours and am not available for appointments. During office hours, specific questions are better than vague ones, even if it’s just “I specifically don’t understand Fig. 4 in this chapter.” A question like “I don’t understand natural selection” is harder for me to work with. I’m also happy to talk about study strategies, classes you might want to take, research opportunities etc. 6.2 UTA Office Hours Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs) will hold office hours throughout the week by in-person and via Zoom. These will be finalized by the 2nd week of class and summarized online. You can attend any UTA’s office hours. UTAs will have access to keys to help you review assignments and recitation materials. UTA’s will read the tests but will not have access to test materials. "],["success.html", "7 How to succeed in Foundations of Biology 2", " 7 How to succeed in Foundations of Biology 2 Have confidence – you can learn the material! Read the textbook pages that will be covered before class. Read slowly and thoroughly, but taking notes isn’t necessary. Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary terms and look up unfamiliar words. Examine all indicated figures and read the figure captions. Analysis of the information in figures plays a HUGE part in assignments and tests! Take notes in class, and review them at least briefly within a few days. I recommend taking notes by hand with pen and paper. If possible, print out the slides and fill in key information. Fill in any unclear sections in your notes with information from the book, other suggested study resources, information from the discussion boards or office hours, etc. Study with a partner or small study group, using Zoom as necessary. Regularly attend office hours with me or the UTAs (or both!), even if it’s just to listen to what other people are asking. Try not to study for long, uninterrupted periods of time without a significant break. Cramming results in - at best - short term retention of material. Two half-hour or 45-minute study sessions are better than one marathon 1-2 hour session. Ask for help when necessary - before you fall behind. Go to office hours as often as necessary. The UTAs and I are here to help!

Foundations II will provide you with a grounding in the major biological concepts related to the molecular basis of genetics, molecular biology, the evolution of life, and ecological interactions. 18.1.1 Molecular genetics We will begin the semester with an introduction to the molecular basis of genetics and heredity, focusing on how the information in DNA is stored, copied, transmitted, and used by organisms through the processes of transcription and translation. 18.1.2 Gene regulation &amp; genomics During the first units we will think mostly in terms of single genes. Later we will widen our scope to include multiple genes in order to examine gene regulation, genomics and epigenetics We’ll also discuss how molecular biologists conduct experiments and the tools they use to manipulate genes and proteins. 18.1.3 Population biology: natural selection, speciation, phylogenetics &amp; ecology Throughout the course we will emphasize the evolutionary background of the topics we discuss. During the second half of the course we will specifically focus on the biology of populations and the dynamics of natural selection, the origin of species (speciation), the evolutionary relationships among species (phylogenetics), and the process of population growth and regulation which are key to understanding evolution (population ecology). 18.1.4 Species interactions &amp; Community ecology We will finish the semester learning about species interactions, such as predators versus their prey, and the structure of communities made up of multiple interacting species. 18.2 Skills: Doing &amp; Communicating Science Foundations 2 will develop your skills as a critical consumer and practitioner of science. By the end of the course you should not only understand the conceptual material presented in the book but also be able to critically approach new scientific material such as scientific talks and journal articles.

The keys for these questions will have a buffer to account for reasonable variation in rounding. For example, if the answer is 50%, grading will be set so that answers from 49% to 51% will be accepted. 24.2 Rounding like a biologist Because chemistry and physics are super precise sciences, chemists and physics profs get really hung up on rounding; biologists generally don’t unless its really necessary. For rounding and reporting answers I recommend these rule of thumb: Your final answer doesn’t usually need to be than 1 or 2 digits more precise than your data. So if I give you frequencies of 0.4 and 0.6 for a Hardy-Weinberg problem, your final answer can be rounded to the hundredths or thousandths (e.g. 0.411, 0.62). If the final answer is &gt;0, round to 2 digits past the decimal place, e.g. round 1.519 to 1.52, and leave 1.49 as 1.49 (don’t up round to 1.5). If the final answer is &lt;0, round to 2 digits past the zeros, e.g., round 0.00148 to 0.0015 and leave 0.0014 as 0.0014 (don’t round to 0.001). To prevent rounding errors retain 2 more digits than needed while doing your work. These aren’t hard and fast rules; luckily I don’t think I’ve ever had a problem on a numeric question that ultimately was the result of variation in approaches to rounding. When making the key to a test I will usually try to work out the math with more than one approach to rounding to account for potential variation. For example, I’ll first do the calculations in a spreadsheet and do the rounding at the end. I’ll then redo the math rounding any intermediary steps. I’ll then set a buffer that accommodates reasonable variation in the answer. I also go back and specifically re-check numeric questions after the test.

They are most useful to look over AFTER you have thoroughly reviewed all your other class materials. If you only look at the study guides you will likely miss a lot of important material.
