# FAQ

Welcome to Foundation 2 with Dr. Brouwer!  This FAQ supplements the syllabus and answers frequently asked questions.  Let me know ( nlb24@pitt.edu ) if you have any additional questions.  

## Frequently asked questions

### "Are we starting online?"

Yes We will begin meeting online for the first 2.5 weeks for both lecture and recitation.  A Zoom link will be sent prior to the first day of class and will also appear on the front page of the course website.


<!-- ## “How will this class be run day-to-day?” -->

<!-- Class will be 100% online with pre-recorded lectures, online quizzes, assignments, and tests, live-streamed recitation sessions (also recorded), and instructor and undergraduate UTA office hours via Zoom.  Below is an outline of each component -->

<!-- Readings:  Readings for each week will be posted in advance.  There will also be a detailed outline of the book indicating focal sections, figures, etc.  See below for information on the textbook. -->
<!-- Lectures:  On Tuesday and Thursday mornings lecture modules will be released.  The core part of the module will be about 65 to 75 minutes of pre-recorded videos, each about 8-15 minutes long.  Each video will be accompanied by a set of slides, information on related readings, and a list of vocab and key concepts.   These questions will be worth points but you’ll be able to revise your answers.  Lecture videos and slides will remain active throughout the course, but questions will close down ~48 hours after they are released (TBD).   -->
<!-- Recitations:  On Fridays we’ll have recitations, with 50-70 students “attending” each recitation.  Most recitations will be a live-streamed problem-solving activity involving small group work.  Most recitations have a digital “worksheet” where answers to the questions discussed in class are submitted.  All recitations will be recorded and all recitation-based assignments can be completed outside of your assigned recitation time. -->
<!-- Problem Sets & Assignments There will be regular problem sets and short assignments - often one to prepare you for recitation and a follow-up to recitation. -->
<!-- Tests: Tests will be online and be taken during the regular class meeting time.  Exact details TBD. -->


### “What textbook will we use?”

Our book for Foundations 2 is the 12th edition of Life: The Science of Biology by Hillis et al. (2020).  

Everyone should have received an email recently from the bookstore discussing the Inclusive Access program using Redshelf.  

If you click on the Macmillan Learning tab on the Canvas sidebar for this course and select "E-Book" you should be taken to the online version of the book.

You have been charted a small fee for online access; if you do not need it you can opt out.  Check your email for instructions.

See the Readings - Assigned textbook materials for more information.

### “Will we use Achieve?”

No, we will not use Achieve for gradeds work.  It will be activated so you can use it for practice questions.  See the Achieve section of the syllabus for details.
 

### “Will we use LaunchPad”

No, we will not use LaunchPad.

 
### "Will any content be asynchronous?"

No, no content will be asynchronous.  This is an in-person course that is beginning online the first 2.5 weeks.  After that it will be fully in person.  Videos will be provided for review.


 

### “What if I get sick this semester?”

In general, for my courses I use a “drop your lowest scores” policy where -- regardless of the reasons -- your lowest score on each major part of your (tests, assignments, etc) gets dropped.  This should accommodate an extended period of illness.   See the full grade breakdown for details
 

### “What if YOU get sick this semester?”

All of my materials have been prepared far enough in advance that I will be able to keep the course running even if I get sick using videos.  I'm fully vaccinated and boosted and not expecting any disruption to the course.

 

### “What topics will we be covering?”

The course covers molecular biology, genomics, evolution, and ecology.  We'll start out with Chapters 13, 14, 15, 16, and Appendix B over the first several weeks.  

 
### “I’m not arriving until after the 1st day of class - is that a problem?”

No problem at all.   Everyone will be participating via zoom the first 2.5 weeks.


<!-- “I’m not in the USA, will this be a problem?” -->
<!-- No, no problem.  The course is designed for any Pitt student in the world to participate.  Everything will be recorded, and every assignment, quiz, test, and assignment will be open for pre-specified periods of time.  -->

 

### “I joined the class late, what can I do?”

All assignments associated with  Unit 1 will remain open for an extended period of time to accommodate people who join the class late.

 
<!-- ## “I am worried about internet access or running out of data.  What can I do?” -->

<!-- This course is 100% online but there are some things we can do to ease the data burden. -->

<!-- If possible, get a hard copy of the book.  While my lectures don’t follow the book exactly, most of what I talk about is in there, and each lecture is referenced on the first slide for the appropriate sections. -->
<!-- Download the “Focal Figures ” slides I’ve made. This will give you copies of all the most important figures for each Chapter.  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vLlpmnx6DvzVSW37pvBkRK2Hx4J6NEVf?usp=sharing  -->
<!-- Find places like Starbuck, public libraries, etc. that have free Wifi you can use. -->
<!-- Get a GMail account if you don’t already have one and install relevant Google Docs apps on your phone.  I can then provide you direct access to course files housed on Google Docs.  When you have access to free or consistent wifi you can then easily download relevant files directly from the file folders that are linked to in Canvas.   -->


 

## Not so Frequently Asked Question
 

### “I want to read ahead, where should I start”

<!-- You can see all figures via the “Focal Figures” folder. -->

### “What do I need to know from previous biology classes?”

See the page "Foundations 1 - things to know"  which lists chapters and focal ideas covered in Pitt’s first semester of biology (Foundations 1) that are most relevant to Foundations 2. 

Depending on your background you may wish to glance over them.
