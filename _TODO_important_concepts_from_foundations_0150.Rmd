#  Foundations 1 - things to know {#f1}

The most important concepts from the first semester of Foundations of Biology will be reviewed at least briefly, and in some cases this material will be covered in-depth.  Below is a summary of key things from the textbook covered in Foundations 1 relevant to this course.

Sections or figures relating to concepts that will be covered or reviewed directly in a lecture or some other material are indicated below with a " (F2!)".  Things not starred will be considered general background knowledge that you should be familiar with.  Unless vocab from these sections occurs in a Foundations 2 lecture you will not be expected to have these terms memorized.  If you need help reviewing anything office hours with me and undergraduate UTAs will be available.  

Note: if a figure is _not_ mentioned, it can be ignored.

<!-- If you donâ€™t yet have access yet to the book, many of the figures mentioned below can be seen by selecting the appropriate chapter from this folder (Links to an external site.).  -->
