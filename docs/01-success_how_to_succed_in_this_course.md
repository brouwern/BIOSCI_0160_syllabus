# How to succeed in Foundations of Biology 2 {#success}


1. **Have confidence** â€“ you can learn the material!  
1. **Read the textbook pages** that will be covered before class. 
1. **Read slowly and thoroughly, but taking notes isn't necessary**. Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary terms and look up unfamiliar words.
1. **Examine all indicated figures and read the figure captions**.  Analysis of the information in figures plays a HUGE part in assignments and tests!
1. **Take notes in class**, and review them at least briefly within a few days.  I recommend taking notes by hand with pen and paper. If possible, print out the slides and fill in key information.
1. **Fill in any unclear sections in your notes** with information from the book, other suggested study resources, information from the discussion boards or office hours, etc.
1. **Study with a partner or small study group**, using Zoom as necessary.
1. **Regularly attend office hours** with me or the UTAs (or both!), even if it's just to listen to what other people are asking.
1. **Try not to study for long, uninterrupted periods of time without a significant break.**  Cramming results in - at best - short term retention of material.  Two half-hour or 45-minute study sessions are better than one marathon 1-2 hour session.
1. **Ask for help when necessary - before you fall behind**. Go to office hours as often as necessary.  The UTAs and I are here to help!
