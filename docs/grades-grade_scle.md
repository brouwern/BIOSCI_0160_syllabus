# Grades - grading scale

Raw percentage grades will be converted to letter grades at the end of the semester using the scale shown below.  This will only be done after the final and the implementation of all dropped grades.

Note: Students planning to major in Biological Sciences must pass this course with a **C** (not C- !) or better.

**Rounding**: Rounding is not done until final grades are computed and is done by computer to 1 decimal place. Final letter grades are assigned after rounding and is done automatically by a computer including the decimal value. For example, a score of 91.99% rounds to 92.0% and is an A, but a score of 91.94% rounds to 91.9% and is an A-.
