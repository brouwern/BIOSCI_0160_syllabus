# Welcome!

This is the syllabus for Dr. Brouwer's section of Foundations of Biology 2.  The syllabus is organized into sections accessible via the menu on the left.  The first few sections are those students most often need to be familiar with at the beginning of the semester.  After that sections are organized approximately alphabetically by major topics.  You can search for terms using the "Search" panel in the top-left corner.

Some policies related to exams and assignments may not be finalized until the first day of class.  I also reserve the right to update and modify the schedule as needed.  All students will be informed verbally and via email about any changes.
