# Point values are relative {#points}

As discussed in the Point Breakdown section, there are different categories of assignments, such as Exams, Pre-recitations, etc.

Each of these categories carries a different weight in the grading, with Exams and the final being the largest.

Therefore, the value of a "point" on an assignment will depend on which type of assignment it is part of.  For example, a 1-point question on an Exam is worth MUCH more than a 1-point question on a recitation assignment.
