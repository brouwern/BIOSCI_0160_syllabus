# Lecture slides

Lecture slides will usually be provided as Google Slides for each lecture, though at times it will be necessary for you to just take notes without access to the slides.  

Google slides can be converted to PDF and PowerPoint. 

 The *target* time for releasing lectures slides will be 5:00 PM on Mondays.
 
Lecture slides are released as a convenience, and I **cannot** guarantee that all or - or even any -  slides will available prior to class.

You should always come to class prepared to take notes on material not available on shared slides.

Moreover, I often emphasize drawing diagrams by hand and will ask you to turn in your versions of figures you've drawn for participation credit.
