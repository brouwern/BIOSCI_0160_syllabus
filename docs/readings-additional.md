# Readings: Additional readings {#additional-readings}

**Many weeks there will be one or more _required_ short to medium-length additional reading to supplement the book. ** 

Links and/or PDFs for these materials will be provided.  Many will be posted on [Foundations of Biology and Environmental Science: An Open-Access Encyclopedia](https://brouwern.github.io/fbes/) https://brouwern.github.io/fbes/ .

These readings will associated with the upcoming recitation or lecture, and some will be from the primary scientific literature.   

> I have carefully selected and often edited these additional readings and I highly recommend that you read them AND refer back to them when reviewing for tests.

Optional **review readings** may also be posted prior to tests.  These will be clearly marked as "optional."
