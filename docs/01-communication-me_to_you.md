#  Communication - from me to you

**Messages via Canvas will be used to regularly communicate key information for the course.**

After the first week, I will generally send out a single message via Canvas on Friday evening after the last recitation.  This will provide information about the relevant readings for the upcoming lectures, assignments, reminders about exams, etc.

Additional messages on time-sensitive issues (e.g. class cancellation due to bad weather) or reminders about upcoming exams will also be released.

Please set your Canvas setting so that all Canvas messages are forwarded to your Pitt email. If you use another email service as your primary email (eg GMail) please set your Pitt email to forward there.

I recommend adjusting your Canvas settings to what works best for you regarding the frequency of messages.  A daily digest of Canvas messages is usually the best so you aren't constantly pinged by messages throughout the day.

All elements of the course will be scheduled to be released on specific days.  Check the course calendar for upcoming due dates.
