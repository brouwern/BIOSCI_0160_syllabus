# Study guides for exams

When preparing for the exams the best guides for studying are:

1. Lecture slides 
1. Your notes
1. Recitation homework assignments
1. Other homework assignments and quizzes
1. Vocab lists associated with slides, readings, and assignments

**Exam studies guides** in the more traditional sense will be made available before each test -- **BUT these study guides are in no way complete, comprehensive, or representative**.  They are most useful to look over AFTER you have thoroughly reviewed all your other class materials.  

If you only look at the study guides you will likely miss a lot of important material.
