# Mental Health & Wellness

School is hard - please take care of yourself as best you can given the many demands on your time. Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive anxiety, or problems with sleeping can interfere with your academic performance. You have a support network here at Pitt to help you through challenging times. Acknowledging that you need help, and getting that help, is smart and courageous.
