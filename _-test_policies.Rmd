# Test-taking policies
 

* There will be 3 mini-tests during the semester.  1 will be dropped as detailed later in the syllabus.
* There are approximately 8 lectures and 3 recitations per unit and mini-test. (Some units may have 3 recitations)
* When a test occurs on a Thursday, lecture material on Tuesday WILL occur on the test unless otherwise stated.
* The recitation the Friday before a test will be used to go over a practice exam.
* If exams are to be taken using Canvas, it is your responsibility to assure that you have adequate power to your device and internet access.
* I will answer no questions during the test.
* If you lose power or internet access before completing the test and receive a sub-optimal score then this score will likely be the test score that gets dropped.
