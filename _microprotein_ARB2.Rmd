https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor
Beta-2 adrenergic receptor

β2-Adrenergic receptor	19	Inhibits translation of β2-Adrenergic receptor by binding to mRNA. The study suggests primary amino acid sequence is necessary for inhibitory effect[45].

MetArgLeuProGlyValArgSerArgProAlaGluProArgArgGlySerAlaAr

The peptide product of a 5' leader cistron in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor mRNA inhibits receptor synthesis.
