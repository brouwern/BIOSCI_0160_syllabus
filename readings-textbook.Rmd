# Readings:  Assigned textbook materials {#textbook}

This course will be structured around focal chapters and/or sections in Life: The Science of Biology, 12th edition by Hillis et al (2020). 

## README: Assigned readings

For a given lecture I will specify focal sections of the book, which importantly **may come from more than one chapter.**  I will be very specific about what to read.

There are many sections, figures, and tables I will tell you to skip (hooray!).

After the first week, information on readings will be announced on Friday.

I highly recommend reading the assigned sections _before_ class;  however, I don't recommend taking  extensive notes or outlining. 

Read the assigned sections to prime your brain for lecture, then refer back to it when reviewing your notes. 

To facilitate review, most lectures will indicate which sections of the book are most related. 

## Digital access to Hillis et al (2020)

You will receive information about _online_ access to the 12th edition of the textbook.  You can opt out of online access if you 

### Acheive

The publisher of the textbook has an interactive website of review materials called Achieve.  I will make this materials available but nothing from this site will be assigned.

## Hardcopy of book

You can obtain a physical copy of the book if you want.  The 12th edition of the book -- which is green and has a bee on the cover -- is very similar to the 11th edition of the book by Sadava et al. (2016), which is orange has a flock of birds on the cover.

I will indicate any important differences between the 12th and 11th edition of the books.
