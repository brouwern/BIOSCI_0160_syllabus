# Lecture slides

Lecture slides will usually be provided as Google Slides for each lecture, though at times it will be necessary for you to just take notes without access to the slides.  

Google slides can be converted to PDF and PowerPoint. 

Slides I release will always be a subset of the slides I actually use and it is your responsibility to take notes during each lecture.
