# Tests - Practice test

The recitation prior to an exam will be used to take prepare for the exam.  A pre-recitation take-home practice test will be given as an assignment, a short practice test will be taken and discussed during recitation, and a follow-up post-recitation practice test will be assigned.

All of this will be required assignments.   These will be based on test questions from previous years and will be administered using Canvas.
