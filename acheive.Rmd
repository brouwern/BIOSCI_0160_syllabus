# Acheive

If you are accessing the textbook online through the information sent to you by the bookstore or purchased a new copy of the textbook you will have access to the publisher's online materials, called Achieve.  (Note that there is an older service called LaunchPad which we no longer use).  

I do NOT assign materials from Achieve but will make them available for relevant chapters. You may find them useful, but I cannot guarantee their relevance to the course and will not answer questions related to them. 

If you use Achieve I recommend talking to the UTAs about which questions are most similar to what will appear on the tests.   

Achieve can be accessed from within Canvas using the "Macmillan Learning" link on the menu to the left.
