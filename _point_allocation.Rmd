# Point allocation & Weighting

The course contains 3 units, and each unit has a test. 

Your lowest scores will be automatically dropped as detailed elsewhere in the syllabus.  (This will not be dropped until final grades are calculated do your grade reported by Canvas will be an under estimate with regards to tests!)

The 5 tests which count towards your grade will contribute towards ~82% of your final grade.  Each mini-test will therefore be worth about 16.5% of your grade. 

Recitation homework, test revisions, other homework assignments, and quizzes will contribute ~18%.  

The full point allocation is shown below.  This is subject to change as necessary if, for example, the number of assignments changes.
