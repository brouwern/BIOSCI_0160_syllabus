<!-- Scores accessed directly via TopHat are likely to not accurately reflect your final scores for the course.  This is because the number of questions in a given assignment may vary and because the actual value of 1 point on Tophat will vary depending on what type of assignment it is.  For example, a pre-test with 25 questions will NOT be worth the same as the 25 questions of a mini-test.  The weighting of grades will take place in Canvas. -->
